  <p>DataCamp Machine Learning for Everyone</p><br>
   <p>- Overall I have become more aware of the process of creating a machine learning model, which made it a lot easier for me when I started creating my own model.</p>

  <p>DataCamp Data Science for Everyone</p><br>

    <p>Cyberthon 2020<br>
    <p>- Even though my group did not really solve a lot of the questions, this event still gave me the opportunity learn about various knowledge ranging from computer networks to ciphers... It was through this event that I get to explore Kali Linux, which is both enriching and fun.</p>
